# NextGen Entertainment Hub

## Overview
NextGen Entertainment Hub is a cross-platform media companion that redefines how users consume digital content across Netflix, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.  
By consolidating fragmented feeds into a unified, intelligent experience, the platform helps users move from endless scrolling to meaningful discovery.

## Problem
- Content overload: Billions of videos across multiple platforms without integrated curation.  
- Decision fatigue: Users spend more time searching than engaging.  
- Fragmented journeys: Short-form content sparks interest, but transitions to long-form content are difficult.  
- Low retention: Saved or liked content is scattered and often forgotten.

1. **ReelTime Digest** – A daily personalized highlight reel generated from a user’s short-form activity.  
2. **MoodFlix** – Mood-based recommendations that match emotional states with relevant genres and formats.  
3. **ClipSync** – Unified curation of saved and liked content across multiple platforms.
